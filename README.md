                  <h2>Early life</h2>
                  <hr>
                  <p>
                    Grisham, the second of five siblings, was born in Jonesboro, Arkansas, to to Wanda (née Skidmore) and John Ray Grisham. His father worked as a construction worker and a cotton farmer, while his mother was a homemaker. When Grisham was four years old,
                    his family settled in Southaven, Mississippi. As a child, he wanted to be a baseball player. In A Painted House, a novel with strong autobiographical elements, the protagonist - a seven-year old farmer boy - manifests a strong wish
                    to become a baseball player. As noted in the forward to Calico Joe, Grisham gave up playing baseball at the age of 18, after a game in which a hostile pitcher aimed a beanball at him, and narrowly missed doing the young Grisham grave
                    harm. Grisham has been a Christian since he was eight years old, and has described his conversion to Christianity as "the most important event" in his life. After leaving law school, he participated in some missionary work in Brazil,
                    under the First Baptist Church of Oxford. Although Grisham's parents lacked formal education, his mother encouraged him to read and prepare for college. He drew on his childhood experiences for his novel A Painted House. Grisham started
                    working for a nursery as a teenager, watering bushes for US$1.00 an hour. He was soon promoted to a fence crew for US$1.50 an hour. He wrote about the job: "there was no future in it". At 16, Grisham took a job with a plumbing contractor
                    but says he "never drew inspiration from that miserable work".[citation needed] Through one of his father's contacts, he managed to find work on a highway asphalt crew in Mississippi at age 17. It was during this time that an unfortunate
                    incident got him "serious" about college. A fight with gunfire broke out among the crew causing Grisham to run to a nearby restroom to find safety. He did not come out until after the police had detained the perpetrators. He hitchhiked
                    home and started thinking about college. His next work was in retail, as a salesclerk in a department store men's underwear section, which he described as "humiliating". By this time, Grisham was halfway through college. Planning to
                    become a tax lawyer, he was soon overcome by "the complexity and lunacy" of it. He decided to return to his hometown as a trial lawyer. He attended the Northwest Mississippi Community College in Senatobia, Mississippi and later attended
                    Delta State University in Cleveland.[4] Grisham drifted so much that he changed colleges three times before completing a degree. He graduated from Mississippi State University in 1977, receiving a BS degree in accounting. He later
                    enrolled in the University of Mississippi School of Law to become a tax lawyer, but his interest shifted to general civil litigation. He graduated in 1981 with a JD degree.</p>

                  <p>
                    <h3>Law and politics</h3>
                    <p>Grisham practiced law for about a decade and won election as a Democrat in the Mississippi House of Representatives from 1984–90, at an annual salary of US$ 8,000.[4][13]</p>
                    <h3>Writing career</h3>
                    <p>This house in Lepanto, Arkansas, was the house used in the Hallmark Hall of Fame movie A Painted House. Grisham said the big case came in 1984, but it was not his case. As he was hanging around the court, he overheard a 12-year-old
                      girl telling the jury what had happened to her. Her story intrigued Grisham, and he began watching the trial. He saw how the members of the jury cried as she told them about having been raped and beaten. It was then, Grisham later
                      wrote in The New York Times, that a story was born.</p>

                    <p>Musing over "what would have happened if the girl's father had murdered her assailants",[10] took three years to complete his first book, A Time to Kill. Finding a publisher was not easy. The book was rejected by 28 publishers before
                      Wynwood Press, an unknown publisher, agreed to give it a modest 5,000-copy printing. It was published in June 1989.</p>

                      <h3>Marriage</h3>
                      <p>Grisham married Renee Jones on May 8, 1981. The couple have two children together: Shea and Ty.[4] Ty played college baseball for the University of Virginia </p>

                <q style="font-family:Alegreya Sans Two;font-size:30px;">
I seriously doubt I would ever have written the first story had I not been a lawyer. I never dreamed of being a writer. I wrote only after witnessing a trial.</q>
